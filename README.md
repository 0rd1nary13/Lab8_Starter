## Graceful Degradation and Service Workers

https://0rd1nary13.github.io/Lab8_Starter/

**How are graceful degradation and service workers related?**

Graceful degradation is the design philosophy of starting with full functionality and ensuring the application remains usable when certain features are unavailable or when technology constraints exist.
Service workers embody graceful degradation by acting as a progressive enhancement layer that improves performance and offline functionality without breaking the core application.
