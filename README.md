## Graceful Degradation and Service Workers

**How are graceful degradation and service workers related?**

Graceful degradation and service workers work hand-in-hand to create resilient web applications that can function across varying network conditions and browser capabilities. Graceful degradation is the design philosophy of starting with full functionality and ensuring the application remains usable when certain features are unavailable or when technology constraints exist.

Service workers embody graceful degradation by acting as a progressive enhancement layer that improves performance and offline functionality without breaking the core application. When a browser supports service workers, users get enhanced performance through intelligent caching, offline capabilities, and faster load times. However, when service workers aren't supported or fail to load, the application still functions normally by falling back to standard network requests - it just won't have the performance benefits and offline capabilities.

This relationship creates multiple levels of graceful degradation:
1. **Network Level**: Service workers cache resources and API responses, allowing the app to function when network connectivity is poor or unavailable
2. **Browser Level**: The app checks for service worker support before registering it, ensuring older browsers can still run the application without errors  
3. **Performance Level**: Even when online, service workers serve cached resources first, providing faster load times while gracefully falling back to network requests for uncached content

This approach ensures that users with modern browsers and reliable connections get the best experience, while users with older browsers or poor connectivity still get a functional application - a perfect example of graceful degradation in action.
